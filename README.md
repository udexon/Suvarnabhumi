## Project Suvarnabhumi -- An Even Greater Singapore at the border of Thailand and West Malaysia

Suvarnabhumi is the name of the mythical kingdom where Buddhism was first propagated in the then barbaric South East Asia, by priests sent by King Asoka the Great of India. Literally it means pure land or land of gold . Its significance in Asian civilizations is like the first Jedi temple of the Star Wars universe.

Singapore's success since its separation from Malaysia in 1965 proves that it is possible for a well managed territory in South East Asia to leapfrog from a backwater fishing village to a first world developed nation within a short span of half a century.

As such, it may now be possible to replicate Singapore's success elsewhere within a shorter time span, culminating in perhaps one of the greatest real estate ventures in the 21st century. 

Are there places in other parts of South East Asia with similar geographical, cultural and political conditions like Singapore?

Southern Thailand it is, the plains stretching from Penang and Kedah in northern Malay Peninsula to Songkhla, separating South China Sea and the Indian Ocean by a mere 90km at its narrowest section.

This "even greater than Singapore" project of the 21st century deserves the name Suvarnabhumi, as the Kedah-Songkhla corridor is geographically and culturally the centre of South East Asia, merging the continental and Buddhist northern half and the maritime Muslim southern half. Plagued by Communist and Islamic insurgents in the past, Suvarnabumi will now bring light and transform this land into the literal gold. 

Only two relatively simple executive orders are needed to kick start Suvarnabhumi:

Free Trade Zones and simplified border movements between Thailand and Malaysia;
A casino license(s), to rival Sihanoukville, just under 500km away in the exact opposite shore facing Songkhla in the north east.

Some Buddhists may object to gambling. However, greater harms lie ahead if Suvarnabhumi does not take off -- South East Asia may degenerate into an even worst breeding ground of Islamic terrorists as it already is. Only casinos and Chinese money and players have the motivations and abilities to subdue and transform Muslim terrorists, in South East Asia and elsewhere. 



## Microscopic Suvarnabhumi -- the Last Frontiers of Shared Economies 

Suvarnabhumi is an inclusive and holistic project that not only benefits investors, but the working class too. In fact, it is the proletariat (working class) whose time is more plentiful than the Bourgeois' (investors) money. To be able to tap into the proletariat's time is more beneficial than Bourgeois' money. As such, the proletariat shall kick start Project Suvarnabhumi.

Consider this question;

-- What else can a Grab Food rider (or anyone) do to become an entrepreneur?

Answer: Find a piece of vacant land within or at the edges of a city, turn it into a barbeque park, deliver fresh barbeque stuff from restaurants, supermarkets or fresh markets. 

Other activities include:

- martial arts training -- land and customers need protection,
- cooking classes, 
- house building,
- container house design etc. (Ask design department.)
- farming.
- Bazaar
- Sell old stuff

The essence of Project Suvarnabhumi (法源净土) is people, their shared knowledge and their relationships to Heaven and Earth. (天地人和)

The shared knowledge amongst people will generate profits, as Sima Qian observed in the Grand Annals 史记： 天下熙熙 皆为利来 天下攘攘 皆为利往。 Note that Sima Qian did not distinguish between Bourgeois and Proletariat, but use an inclusive term 天下, literally "under the heaven", i.e. the Earth and the people.

We could not find an extant translation of Suvarnabhumi in Chinese. 净土 (Jingtu) Pure land seems to be the closest. However, 净土 has been used to refer to a specific school in Buddhism that focuses on the "pure land afterlife". As such, we use 法源净土 for Suvarnabhumi, where 法源 means the source of Dharma, alluding the place where Buddhism was first propagated in South East Asia.
